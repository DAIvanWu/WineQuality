1 -固定酸度:大多数酸与葡萄酒有关，或者是固定的或非挥发性的(不容易蒸发) 
2 -挥发性酸度:葡萄酒中醋酸的含量，过高会导致令人不快的醋味 
3 -柠檬酸:少量的柠檬酸可以给葡萄酒增加“新鲜度”和风味 
4 -残糖:发酵停止后剩余的糖量，很少会发现小于1克/升的葡萄酒和大于45克/升的葡萄酒被认为是甜的 
5 -氯化物:葡萄酒中的盐量 
6 -游离二氧化硫: SO2的游离形式存在于分子SO2 (作为溶解气体)和亚硫酸氢盐离子之间的平衡中；它防止微生物生长和葡萄酒的氧化 
7 -总二氧化硫: SO2的游离和结合形式的量；在低浓度下，SO2在葡萄酒中几乎无法检测到，但在游离SO2浓度超过50 ppm时，SO2在葡萄酒的气味和味道中变得明显 
8 -密度:根据酒精和糖的含量百分比，水的密度接近水的密度 
9 - pH :描述葡萄酒在0 (非常酸性)至14 (非常碱性)之间的酸性或碱性程度；大多数葡萄酒的pH值在3 - 4之间 
10 -硫酸盐:一种葡萄酒添加剂，能促进二氧化硫气体( S02 )的含量，起到抗菌和抗氧化的作用 
11 -酒精:酒的酒精含量百分比 输出变量(基于感官数据) : 
12 -质量(得分在0到10之间)


1 - fixed acidity: most acids involved with wine or fixed or nonvolatile (do not evaporate readily)

2 - volatile acidity: the amount of acetic acid in wine, which at too high of levels can lead to an unpleasant, vinegar taste

3 - citric acid: found in small quantities, citric acid can add 'freshness' and flavor to wines

4 - residual sugar: the amount of sugar remaining after fermentation stops, it's rare to find wines with less than 1 gram/liter and wines with greater than 45 grams/liter are considered sweet

5 - chlorides: the amount of salt in the wine

6 - free sulfur dioxide: the free form of SO2 exists in equilibrium between molecular SO2 (as a dissolved gas) and bisulfite ion; it prevents microbial growth and the oxidation of wine

7 - total sulfur dioxide: amount of free and bound forms of S02; in low concentrations, SO2 is mostly undetectable in wine, but at free SO2 concentrations over 50 ppm, SO2 becomes evident in the nose and taste of wine

8 - density: the density of water is close to that of water depending on the percent alcohol and sugar content

9 - pH: describes how acidic or basic a wine is on a scale from 0 (very acidic) to 14 (very basic); most wines are between 3-4 on the pH scale

10 - sulphates: a wine additive which can contribute to sulfur dioxide gas (S02) levels, wich acts as an antimicrobial and antioxidant

11 - alcohol: the percent alcohol content of the wine.  Output variable (based on sensory data): 

12 - quality (score between 0 and 10)
